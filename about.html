        <h1>About Me, Steven Qian</h1>
        <div class="container" id="text">
            <p>Hm about me… Well for starters, my name is Steven, and I’m currently a sophomore at Stanford University. I still have that youthful mentality of wanting to change the world, and hope to do so somewhere along the lines of either revolutionary software development or sustainable human civilizations on mars. This being said, when I’m not busy studying for my reasonable goals, I really enjoy “expressing myself” through music and breaking. I love singing, and playing piano, which eventually led me to pick up guitar and viola. However, if it’s up to me, my love of music stems mainly from just being able to listen to it. I have spent hours on end just laying in bed with a good pair of headphones forgetting about all my current problems, and that has probably got me through some of the most difficult times of my life. Ah yes, I also mentioned breaking, which is breakdancing, not smashing dishes. I’m definitely not the best, or remotely close for that matter, but I find this pastime of mine as something that I really can just lose myself in. After a long day of classes and work, a midnight session can be quite the liberation from the everyday stress such highly competitive environments can bring out.</p><br>

            <p>Now don’t worry, I do other things besides enjoying myself (though I truly enjoy what I do). My academic passions had always been deeply rooted in Physics and technology. Coming to Stanford was definitely a culture shock. Everyone was smart. Being so used to accepting I was one of the best in high school made it rather hard to get accustomed to having people constantly outperform me in almost every way. After finishing my freshman year, I decided to take the summer to catch up. I studied almost everything about computer science I could get my hands on, including some web development material, which allowed me to build this site. I covered two quarters of math to get a better grasp of the things that I was going to learn in the upcoming year. And of course once I got back to school, nothing much changed… Sadly, I am still in this situation, trying to figure out what I am going to do. But hey, check back some time, and I’ll keep you posted!
